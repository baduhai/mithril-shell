# Introduction

Tritanium Shell adds a few things to improve your linux desktop experience:
- A status bar at the top of your desktop.
- A dropdown quicksettings menu accessible from the status bar.
- A control center.
  This is a lightly patched version of the GNOME control center.
- An optional on screen display popup for volume.

More things will be added as the project continues to be developed!

The aim of this project is to bring the best parts from the polished experience of the GNOME desktop
environment to hyprland.
Full feature parity with GNOME is a non-goal of this project, as is replicating its interface 1:1.
