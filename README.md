# Tritanium Shell

An opinionated desktop shell that works out of the box, including a bar and more.
It is built with [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) and meant to be used on hyprland with
home-manager.

The aim of this project is to bring the best parts from the polished experience of the GNOME desktop
environment to hyprland.
Full feature parity with GNOME is a non-goal of this project, as is replicating its interface 1:1.
